  # arm64 macOS only. macos-13 is GitHub's last Intel image and is being
  # retired, so the matrix stopped building macos-x86_64 -- and a formula with
  # an on_intel block pointing at an asset that is never built fails at
  # download time with no explanation. This refuses up front and says why.
  # Intel Macs are served by `pipx install ai-browser-toolkit`.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Check what this needs and whether you have it:
        abt doctor

      It drives an existing Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and bundles
      neither. `abt doctor --install-browser` will fetch Chrome via Homebrew.

      To start the server at logon:
        abt autostart install --browser chrome

      Homebrew has no uninstall hook, so `brew uninstall` will NOT remove that
      launchd agent. Run `abt autostart uninstall` before uninstalling, or the
      agent fails at your next login.
